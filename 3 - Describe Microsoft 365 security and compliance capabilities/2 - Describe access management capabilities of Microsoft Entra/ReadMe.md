- **Conditional Access**: 
  - Policies that enforce access requirements based on user conditions (e.g., location, device state, etc.)
  - Example: A policy that only allows access to sensitive data from trusted devices.

- **RBAC**:
  - Helps ensure that users only have access to the resources they need based on their roles.
  - Example: An HR manager has access to employee records, while a marketing manager only has access to marketing tools.

- **Global Secure Access**:
  - Provides secure access globally, ensuring that remote workers can access resources securely from anywhere.
  - Example: Using a VPN or other secure access methods to protect resources while allowing users to work remotely.
