### **Learning Objectives**
By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

- **Describe Conditional Access in Microsoft Entra**
- **Describe Global Secure Access in Microsoft Entra**
- **Describe Microsoft Entra roles and role-based access control (RBAC)**

#### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important**
- The **security perimeter** is no longer confined to organizational boundaries. It now extends to user, device, and service identities.
- Applications and data are increasingly moving to the cloud, requiring advanced security measures like **Conditional Access** and **Global Secure Access**.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**

- **Conditional Access**: A set of policies that enforce access decisions based on a variety of signals, such as user location, device health, and risk factors.
- **Zero Trust**: A security model that assumes no user or device is trusted by default, regardless of their location, and always verifies access before granting it.
- **Global Secure Access**: Microsoftâ€™s Security Service Edge solution that integrates identity and network security controls to protect both cloud and on-premises resources.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A system for granting access to resources based on a user's role within an organization, implementing the principle of **least privilege**.

#### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1589F0/1589F0.png) **Additional but Important**
- Microsoft Entra is designed to secure access by combining both **identity-based security** (like Conditional Access) and **network-based security** (like Global Secure Access).
- This integration helps to protect both internet-facing and internal resources, supporting a **Zero Trust** security strategy.

#### ![#f0e15d](https://placehold.co/15x15/f0e15d/f0e15d.png) **Supporting Details/Examples**

- **Conditional Access**:
  - Helps organizations enforce policies that control access based on conditions like device health, location, or user behavior.
  - Example: A user may be required to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) if accessing resources from an untrusted network.

- **Zero Trust**:
  - Assumes no entity (user or device) is inherently trustworthy.
  - Always verifies trustworthiness through continuous authentication and authorization checks.
  - Example: A user must authenticate every time they access different parts of the network, even if they are already logged in.

- **Global Secure Access**:
  - Ensures secure access to both **cloud-based resources** and those hosted on **private infrastructure** or on-premises.
  - Example: A remote worker accessing sensitive data will be secured by Global Secure Access, ensuring the connection is safe, regardless of location.

- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**:
  - Grants users access to resources based on their roles, limiting them to only what is necessary for their job.
  - Example: An HR manager might have access to employee data, but a marketing manager would only have access to marketing tools, following the **least privilege** principle.
