# Hybrid Identity Overview

#### ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **Important** 
Hybrid identity allows for a common identity across on-premises and cloud-based applications, making it easier for users to access resources from various locations.

#### ![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) **Key terms and definitions**

- **Hybrid Identity**: A combination of on-premises and cloud-based identity solutions to provide a unified identity across different applications.
- **Inter-Directory Provisioning**: The process of creating an identity in one directory system (e.g., Active Directory) and syncing it with another (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID).
- **Synchronization**: Ensures that identity information for on-premises users and groups matches with their cloud-based counterparts.

- **Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync**: A tool that helps organizations accomplish hybrid identity goals by syncing and provisioning users, groups, and contacts to Microsoft Entra ID.
  - Uses the **Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync Agent** to act as a bridge between Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID.
  - The agent provides a lightweight provisioning experience that requires minimal configuration.
  - **SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management)** is used to automate the exchanging of identity information between domains.
